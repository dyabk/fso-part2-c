# Notes App (frontend/backend) -- discontinued
The backend part of the Notes application that lets users save interesting notes about anything.

## Technologies used
React.js, JSON server, CSS
Started working on "backend", i.e. server-side functionality, in addition to the client-side functionality.

### P.S.
It's a legacy repository. From now on, the latest version of the app is in the dyabk/notes-fullstack repository.
